Spring 2019, CS591 Learning From Data Term Project

This is a convolutional neural network using keras, on top of tensorflow, to classify images.

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bXZzYlsX0USmF4_Wm8QcxgNJ8RJkiPil). After you put the parent folder somewhere, you need to create system variables for the training set and testing set. The training set variable is named 'CS591LFDTRAINDIR'. The testing set variable is named 'CS591LFDTESTDIR'. The variables are absolute directories of the datasets.
